      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "NumPy is not a tool for web development.",
        "b": "Correct! NumPy is used for numerical computations and handling large datasets efficiently.",
        "c": "While animations can use numerical data, NumPy is not primarily for this purpose.",

        "d": "numpy.create([1, 2, 3])"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is incorrect as the `np` prefix is missing.",
        "b": "Correct! The `np.array()` function is the standard way to create a NumPy array.",
        "c": "This syntax is incorrect for creating a NumPy array.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Sum computes the total, not the mean.",
        "b": "Correct! `np.mean()` calculates the mean of array elements.",
        "c": "Median is not the same as the mean; it identifies the middle value.",
        "d": "While `np.average()` can compute the mean, `np.mean()` is more common."

      "question": "What does the slicing syntax `arr[1:3]` do in NumPy?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Selects elements 1 and 3.",
        "b": "Selects elements at indices 1 and 2.",
        "c": "Selects all elements except at indices 1 and 3.",
        "d": "Selects elements from index 0 to 3."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is incorrect because slicing does not select non-contiguous indices.",
        "b": "Correct! `arr[1:3]` selects elements at indices 1 and 2.",
        "c": "Slicing does not exclude specific indices but selects a range.",
        "d": "This is incorrect as slicing starts at 1 and ends before 3."

        "c": "np.modify()",
        "d": "np.form()"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "While `np.resize()` can change array size, `np.reshape()` is specifically for reshaping.",
        "b": "Correct! `np.reshape()` changes the dimensions of an array.",
        "c": "NumPy does not have a `modify()` function.",
        "d": "This is not a valid NumPy function."
