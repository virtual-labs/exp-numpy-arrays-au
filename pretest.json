        "a": "A Python library for web development",

        "a": "NumPy is not for web development.",
        "b": "Correct! NumPy is primarily used for numerical computations and handling arrays.",

        "a": "Correct! `import numpy as np` is the standard way to import NumPy.",
        "b": "This is incorrect; it's missing the alias.",
        "c": "This is incorrect. `np` is an alias, not a separate package.",

        "a": "Correct! `np.array([1, 2, 3])` is the correct syntax for creating a NumPy array.",
        "b": "This is incorrect. You need to use `np.array()`.",
        "c": "This is incorrect, as `array()` is not a NumPy function on its own.",

        "a": "Correct! `np.size()` is used to find the number of elements in an array.",
        "b": "NumPy doesn't have a `count()` function for this purpose.",
